=== Haskell stm-chans package AUTHORS/THANKS file ===

The stm-chans package was written (predominantly) by wren ng thornton
and is released under the terms in the LICENSE file. Some important
improvements to TBChan and TBMChan were contributed by Thomas
DuBuisson, incorporating parts of his bounded-tchan package. These
improvements reduce contention between readers and writers, improving
throughput by 2--3 times when producers and consumers are running
in separate OS threads.
